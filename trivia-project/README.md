**CMSI 2022** Mobile Application Development, Spring 2023

# Assignment 0503
This is it, this is what we have been building toward: a mobile app fully conceived, designed, and implemented by you. By doing so, you will demonstrate the ability to ideate, design, and implement a beautiful, secure mobile application of your choice, using both a third-party API and a secure database, in a team of students, with well-defined roles, following modern development practices.

## Background Reading
All prior readings and resources can come into play here; no new baseline technical information is involved. Keep all prior links from all prior assignments handy.

New information may be required for specific solutions to specific issues in your specific app, and for that, we’ll want you to exercise the ability to search the web on your own while also knowing when the most effective overall use of everyone’s time is to ask questions directly.

## For Submission
Create a mobile app—that’s it!

🤔

Welllll, we _do_ want this app to be the culmination of what has been learned this semester. As such, your app must:
- Properly use authentication
- Communicate with at least one third-party web service API
- Use a database to persist application-specific information

In addition, we will have you follow a [specific process](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/ideation/) for _ideating_ your app. You will document this process as follows:
- Develop an _ideation.md_ file that records the results of your team’s _preliminary ideation_ process (we will work on this during the 0419 class session)
- Participate in in-class _pitch exercises_ to crystallize your idea (it’s OK to already be at work on your idea by this time—the exercise is more about refining the way you express your idea)—record the results of these exercise with a _pitch.md_ file (we will do this exercise during the 0424 class session)
- During the final exam slot designated by the registrar for this course, teams will give a final presentation and demo of their respective apps (three minutes max). The content of this presentation will be captured in an _about.md_ file

Note that the above activities demand attendance due to both the nature of the process and out of respect to your teammates and fellow students. Please plan accordingly.

As before, continue to reinforce and build upon the skills you have already learned:
* Use of model objects to separate data storage from in-app structures and data from presentation
* Retrieval from and interaction with different back-ends
* Abstraction of back-end operations behind classes, objects, methods, and functions (async where appropriate)
* Appropriate user interface feedback for operations-in-progress
* Correct error handling with messaging to the user when appropriate
* Effective layout via proper composition of stacks, spacers, padding, and other SwiftUI features
* Appealing color choices and visuals—demonstrate your mastery of views and their properties (without violating any iOS Human Interface Guidelines 😅)
* Proper choice of input views and controls
* Well-chosen animations or transitions beyond the standard SwiftUI view behaviors
* Well-chosen programmed graphics using paths, gradients, and related functions
* Custom app icon

## Documentation Outlines/Templates
Use the following outlines to drive what goes into _ideation.md_, _pitch.md_, and _about.md_. Note that the first two items are clearly derived from the [ideation process](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/ideation/) on Dr. Toal’s website. The _about.md_ outline should also serve as a guide to your final presentation.

### _ideation.md_—Preliminary Ideation Results
1. Which audiences did you consider, and which one did you settle on for your app?
2. List the ten needs that you identified for your chosen audience
3. State the three needs that were chosen out of the ten, and state the projects that you mapped to those needs
4. For each of the three projects, list the goals/ideas that you brainstormed for them
5. State the “winner” of this process

### _pitch.md_—Pitch Exercise Results
Combining your preliminary ideation content and the feedback heard on 0424…
1. Provide the inspiration statement that you crafted for your chosen audience
2. Provide the 2–3 possible solutions that you picked out from preliminary ideation to express during the exercise
3. State the idea that your team chose during preliminary ideation and how you fleshed it out
4. Provide the final version of the human story for your app, after initially drafting it during the exercise and receiving feedback from other teams

### _about.md_—Final Presentation/Description of Your Mobile App
* Provide a title for your overall project (it doesn’t have to be the app’s name, but it should certainly describe it)
* List your team and supply your general roles
* Explain your user audience and their needs
* Show screenshots of your app (during the presentation, this should be live/video)
* State technology highlights: the API you use, what you store in your database, anything cool, hot, challenging, or annoying/frustrating
* List any acknowledgements/thanks/credits

## Operational Tips/Suggestions
* Preliminary ideation should give you sufficient scope to start developing the software, so don’t wait to do that with your team so that software development can commence! The semester will be over before you know it. The ideation exercises and elevator pitch will refine your app idea and how you express it to others but are not expected to cause your app to change drastically
* Note again that the wealth of possibilities means that self-study and experimentation are built into the work involved with this assignment. Make sure to plan accordingly! Learning the material together will help, with multiple eyes looking at the same documentation
* You _will_ make mistakes, change your mind about features, or run into dead ends, all of which will take time—ideally, _build that time in_ when planning out how you will work on the app
* Many operational tips and suggestions from the past assignments also still apply—don’t hestitate to review them!

### Initial setup: Unifying your GitHub and Xcode repositories
This is routine for you now right??? 🤨 For completeness this section is copied from the first assignment’s instructions, and remains relevant if you need to merge an Xcode-created _git_ repository and the GitHub Classroom assignment repo so it is reproduced here.

> The repository for this assignment comes _only_ with this _README.md_ by design, so that you can go through the motions of creating the app project in Xcode yourself. Checking _Create Git repository on my Mac_ will set things up properly but as a _separate_ repository from the one that you get with the assignment, and it takes some specialized _git_ commands to “cross the streams” successfully 👻
>
> So, instead of the usual `git clone` command, do the following:
> 1. Create your initial Xcode project on your machine with the _Create Git repository on my Mac_ option checked
> 2. Acquire the URL of your assignment repository from the green `Code` button on GitHub—let’s call this `YOUR_REMOTE_URL` (this is also what you would do before doing an initial `git clone`, but in this case we will do something different with it—read on)
> 3. Make sure that you don’t have any pending changes on your Xcode project—if so, commit them
> 4. From the command line, `cd` into your Xcode project’s folder and type the following three commands:
>
> ```
> git remote add origin YOUR_REMOTE_URL
> git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
> git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
> ```
>
> (don’t forget to substitute `YOUR_REMOTE_URL` above for the specific URL of your GitHub repository)
>
> That should do it! The repository created by Xcode and the assignment repository that GitHub Classroom gave you should now be “as one.” You should now be able to use _git_ on this folder as if you had `git clone`-d it normally.

If you get the “You have divergent branches…” message upon doing the `git pull`, invoke `git config pull.rebase false` then attempt the `pull` again.

And remember that <kbd>:</kbd><kbd>w</kbd><kbd>q</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd> is the key sequence that gets you out of the _vi_ auto-generated commit message display, in case that comes up.

## How to Turn it In
Commit the following to your repository:
- Complete Xcode project with all code, raw data, and assets
- _ideation.md_—must be _content-complete_ by **0424**
- _pitch.md_—must be _content-complete_ by **0426**
- _about.md_—you may use different visuals for your final presentations (e.g., a slide or video presentation), but your presentation’s _content_ must be delivered in a form suitable for reading as this Markdown file

“Content-complete” means that the most recent commits of the respective files on the given dates must show all of the expected information for those documents. Refinements and polish are permitted after, but major content changes will incur punctuality deductions.
