# Trivia-Time
Trivia-Time is a project I worked on when I took my Mobile Application Development course with a partner. This app was developed with Swift and allows users to:
- login/create an account
- play a quick trivia game answering 10 random questions generated from a Trivia API
- send their scores to a leaderboard to compare to other players

The score is calculated based on
- correct/incorrect answers
- time remaining at the end of the 10 questions

### Technologies Used
- Swift: iOS development
- Firebase/Firestore: authentication & leaderboard
- Trivia API: generating random trivia questions

### Future Feature Ideas
- Longer trivia games
- Collaborative features (battle modes, following your friends)
- Category-specific games (sports, history, etc)

### Video Demo
Since the codebase features sensitive information, I have decided to include a video demo instead to showcase the app's functionality.
